# DynamicDropDowns
This project shows how to handle dynamic drop down menus, which are essentially menus that auto-fill based on the words you type, it will find a match and display your options. In this section I show how to send keys and narrow down your search menu options, then identify all the possible options with a common attribute. We use this attribute to create a list, which we saved in a variable called countries. We then created a for loop to iterate until it found the text we were looking for ("India"), and it had a break so it stopped once it was finished finding what we needed. Then it shows the steps used to confirming the content of what the text field displays using the get_attribute. It was confirmed using an assertion. This project was created using Python Selenium and PyCharm.
